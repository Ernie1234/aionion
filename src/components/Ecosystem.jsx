            $Aion ecosystem is built to ensure that sustainbility of Ai-Onion is
            maintained. Our first goal is to achieve a target of $1. The swap
            and staking platform will create a strong utility for the solana
            ecosystem and other projects. Holders of $Aion will be able to stake
            their tokens to earn Solana and other solana projects. $Aion skaking
            platform will have a farming pool which will accomodate other
            projects of the solana ecosystem, where users can stake tokens and
            be rewarded. Active users of Ai-Onion swap and staking platforms
            will be airdropped
